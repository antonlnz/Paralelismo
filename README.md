# Parallelism Practices

## [Practice 1](./P1) 
This practice consisted in counting the occurrences of several letters in a DNA sequence, each process will count one letter (read the [explanation of the practice](./P1/Practica1.pdf)).

## [Practice 2-A](./P2-A) 
The [first part of the second practice](./P2-A/Practica2.pdf) consists of using MPI collectives to replace "send" and "receive".

## [Practice 2-B](./P2-B) 
The [second part of the second practice](./P2-B/Practica2.pdf) consists of programming the MPI collective functions "Bcast" and "Reduce".

## [Practice 3](./P3) 
The [third practice](./P3/Practica3.pdf) consists of calculating the similarity vector of a set of DNA strands stored in a matrix.
